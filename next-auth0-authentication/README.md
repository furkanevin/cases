# AuthApp

This is a simple web application built with Next.js that demonstrates user authentication using NextAuth.js and Auth0. It includes a basic setup for a home page, a protected page, and an admin-only area.

## üöÄ Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- An [Auth0 account](https://auth0.com/)

### üîß Installation

    npm install
    ```

    Or using yarn:

    ```bash

    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and add the following variables. You can get these values from your Auth0 application settings.

    ```
    AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=your_auth0_client_id
    AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=your_auth0_client_secret
    AUTH0_ISSUER=https://your-auth0-domain
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET=a_secure_random_string
    ```

    You can generate a secure random string for `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` using the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    openssl rand -base64 32
    ```
